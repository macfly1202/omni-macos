# Build Omni.app (Release by default: ./Scripts/build-app.sh [Debug|Release]).
#
# Why this script instead of a plain `xcodebuild`:
# swift-tokenizers ships its Rust backend as an SE-0482 `staticLibrary` artifactbundle. SwiftPM
# honors the artifact's clang module map + headers, but xcodebuild does NOT expose that module,
# so `canImport(TokenizersRust)` is false in TokenizersFFI and the FFI calls go undefined
# ("cannot find 'uniffi_...' in scope"). Project-level build settings can't fix it because the
# failing target is the *package's* TokenizersFFI, which doesn't inherit our project settings.
# The fix is to pass the module map + static lib as GLOBAL command-line overrides, which apply
# to every target in the build, including package targets.

# Shared with run-tests.sh, which moves Omni.xcodeproj out of the tree while it runs. Regenerating
# a project while that is happening produces one with no development team, and its restore then
# nests the backup inside ours. See the comment in run-tests.sh.
